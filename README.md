# Event App
Design an event application.

### Your application should accomplish the following:
* Able to create, read, update, and delete events
* Show a daily, weekly, and monthly calendar view
* Only one event per time slot
* Handle differing timezones

### The app should follow these rules:
* You may use the language of your choice.
* The frontend portion of your app is entirely freeform.
* If you use MySQL or similar, you must provide a SQL script to create the schema as part of your pull request.
* No existing MVC frameworks
